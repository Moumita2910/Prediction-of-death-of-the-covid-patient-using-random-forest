# Prediction-of-death-of-the-covid-patient-using-random-forest
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. But the Medical symptoms of a patient Can identify whether someone has Covid or not. In this research, a clinical symptom dataset of covid patient who are admitted to hospitals will be used to classify the symptoms using a Decision Tree algorithm and random forest algorithm. Our concept is to cover a dataset into a model such that the covid patientâ€™s death can be predicted or be decided via algorithm. We have implemented both of the algorithm but noticed that the Decision Algorithm gives us the best result.
